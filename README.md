# Developer-Portfolio   [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

This is a repository for my developer portfolio. It was created in order to showcase my work to prospective employers. From creating this application, I was able to create my first web application using React. From creating this application as a developer, I was able to further enhance my proficiency in using React components to render pieces of a webpage at a time depending on the state. 

## Usage

In order to use this project, you will need to go to the deployed website >>> Click [Here](https://brilliant-crisp-fbf9ab.netlify.app/Portfolio). When hitting the landing page you will notice that you are taken to the About Me Section that tells a little about the author (Me). At the top of the page you can see a navigation bar that takes you to different pages. Clicking on navigation bar title will redirect you to that page. You will notice that the url changes depending on which navigation bar title you click. Also, clicking my name in the top left hand corner will take you to a home page that is different from the landing page. Below you can see a screen shot of the landing page.
